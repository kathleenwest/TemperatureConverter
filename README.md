# TemperatureConverter

Project Blog Article: https://portfolio.katiegirl.net/2018/07/29/temperature-conversion-console-application/

This is a very simple console application that I completed for a class assignment. 
It is shown here to illustrate my coding style, structure, and commenting. 
This example is considered Level 1 â€“ Easy. 
The application displays temperature conversion tables.

The main objectives of this assignment were:
- To exercise with conditional and iteration algorithms
- To learn how to use string.Format
- To work with methods having parameters and a return type.

The program displays a list of temperatures in Celsius degrees converted to Fahrenheit and vice versa. 
A menu is provided for the user to choose the type of conversion: The menu repeats until the user chooses 0 to
exit.

When option 1 is chosen, the program calculates and displays a list of values between 0 and 212
degrees in Fahrenheit converted to Celsius degrees as shown in the next image.
When option 2 is selected, the program lists values from 0 to 100 Celsius converted to Fahrenheit degrees. 

Use the conversion formulas:

F = 9/5 * C + 32

C = 5/9 *(F - 32)
